# Python-Programming-Exercises
Exercises taken from 2 books:

"Python Programming And Numerical Methods: A Guide For Engineers And Scientists" by Qingkai Kong, Timmy Siauw, and Alexandre Bayen at https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/Index.html
and 
The UC Davis Jupyter notebooks provided by Harishankar Manikantan at https://hmanikantan.github.io/ECH60/

Exercises are taken directly from the Jupyter notebook links above and are not my own work. My attempts I have written in the Jupyter notebooks.
